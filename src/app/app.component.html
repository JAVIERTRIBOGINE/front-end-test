    <h1>Test Front-end</h1>
    <p>
      In this exercise, you will have to build a component exactly like this
      one.
    </p>
  </app-box>
  <app-box class="component">
    <form [formGroup]="form" novalidate>
      <img class="fake-component" src="assets/fake-component.png" />
      <app-selector
      [days]="days"
      [multiple]="multiple"
      formControlName="selectedDays"
      [resize$]="resize$"
      ></app-selector>
    </form>
  </app-box>
  <app-box class="component-description">
    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <img src="assets/component-interface.png" alt="Component interface" />
    <h4>Basic</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design the component using CSS and HTML.</li>
      <li>
        Make it work with the Array&lt;Day&gt; generated in the AppComponent
        (days)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an input attribute [multiple]="boolean" to the component. If
        multiple true, the component will allow selecting more than one date, in
        other case, only once.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Medium</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add pagination to the component and the buttons to control it. Look at
        the shadows that appears in both sides if there are more pagination.
      </li>
      <li>Make it compatible with the reactive form.</li>
      <li>
        Do test cases you consider necessary in order to check the component
        works properly.
      </li>
      <li>Run lint and fix lint issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Advanced</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make it Responsive: Ensure that the component adapts to its parent
        container when the browser is resized or the parent container size
        decreases. It's important not to reset pagination and to handle resizing
        in a way that the page adjusts as if it were initially loaded. For
        example:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Initial window: [1,2,3,4,5]</li>
          <li>Click next: [6,7,8,9,10]</li>
          <li>
            When resizing to a width where only 3 elements fit, the displayed
            elements should be [7,8,9]. This is because if you start from the
            beginning, it would be [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9].
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Finally, generate a git patch with all changes and send it to
      sergio@tulotero.es.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you encounter any difficulties while working on the exercise, please
      feel free to send the patch even if you aren't able to complete any of the
      latest point. We encourage you to submit your progress or any code changes
      you've made, even if it's not the final solution.
    </p>

    Good luck! :-)
